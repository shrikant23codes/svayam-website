To get a fresh perspective on the company after a long gap I have been going through the last quarter concalls of some of the companies that I follow. Given the upcoming Q3FY26 concall, right now going through the Q2FY26 concall, starting with CHEMPLASTS.

**Disclaimer**: These are my notes from the concall—I may have misunderstood some points or gotten numbers wrong. Happy to correct any errors.

Notes:
- Import of Suspensive PVC (S-PVC) from China a major competition.

- Produces S-PVC, paste-PVC, value added chemicals, etc

- Cuddalore, Co. has paste-pvc plant. **[Side Note]**: This place in Tamil Nadu is a heavy industries hub.

- Indian refrigerant gas market. General refrigerant market one of the fastest growing globally.

- Co. setting up a new greenfield plant for refrigerant gas. R32

- China's anti-involution drive to create fair competition among its companies in various sectors. This creates opportunities for companies in other countries. Something with Co. can take advantage of.

- India if it can reduce its imports from EU and China will help Co.

- S-PVC demand in India = 4.3 million tonnes but domestic supply = 1.5 million tonnes only. A big gap to fill here.

- ADD -> Anti-dumping duty result awaited on PVC.

- European firms doing cross subsidised exports, where locally they sell on high margins but in export markets they sell on reduced margins.

- Refrigerant gas quota per country. Companies producing refrigerant gas in India -> SRF, Navin Fluorine, Gujarat Flurochemicals.

- Things to look out for in next Q:
  - Capex update
  - Any positive news from agro-chemical side
  - Any debt reduction started or any more debt added?
  - Any policy update?
