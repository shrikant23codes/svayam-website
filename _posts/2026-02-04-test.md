Since I started integrating AI deeply into my workflow, my baseline for quality has shifted dramatically.

A few days ago I was iterating on a single UI card. I kept taking screenshots, dropping them into NotebookLM, feeding it references (books, patterns, screenshots), and asking, "What's missing? What would a good designer point out?" I did the same loop across a few other tools too. My goal was to reach 70-80% of a professional designer's output.

Most models caught things I missed. And the more context I gave, the sharper the responses.
